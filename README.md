# RecursiveFibonacci
We white boarded this challenge as a group and got the sudo code done in about 30 minuts.  With that in mind, the actual code only took another 30 minuts, so in all, this took about an hour to complete.  the method takes 3 arguments, 0, 1, and x which is the user input number.  x is used as a counter to run the sequence x number of times, giving us the requested fibonacci number.  using recursion, i'm able to change the pass new values back into the method.  The biggest challenge was finding the right spot to place my writeLine.
